// 32. You are working on an aquarium-simulation class named Aquarius. You
// already have a method that adds a Fish object to the aquarium and returns the
// remaining fish capacity. This method has the following declaration:

// public int addFish( Fish f )

// Now you want to provide for adding a whole school of fish at once. The
// proposed method declaration is as follows:

// protected boolean addFish( Fish[] f )

// The idea is that it will return true if there is more room in the tank or
// false if the tank is too full.

// Which of the following statements about this proposal are true?

// This technique is called overloading. +
// This technique is called overriding.
// The compiler will reject the new method because the return type is different.
// The compiler will reject the new method because the access modifier is
// different.
